<h1>Doing a PhD with me</h1>

I am always happy to hear from strong students. You would normally be
interested in working in software engineering, probably with a mathematical
angle, and would have some idea of the field of study: perhaps you have an
idea of a possible topic and some questions about it. Please do not mail me
at a stage where you have no idea at all what you want to work on: do some
investigation first. 

<p> 

As part of your application you will write a research proposal a few pages
long. I regard this as very important, since it is often the best
information about someone's research potential. (A common problem is that
people want to do PhDs in software engineering who are excellent software
engineers but have no idea of what research is about: this is a recipe for
disaster.) It does not have to be long, and what it proposes does not have
to be your eventual topic, but it needs to demonstrate that you have the
ability to think about a problem, do some investigation into the state of
the art, and identify unsolved problems and a possible approach. 
Unfortunately it is common for research proposals to turn out to be cobbled
together from different web pages: the associated applications get
rejected!

<p>

Applications are managed centrally, see our <a
href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/postgraduate/">PhD application</a> page. If
you want to work specifically with me, it is a good idea to contact me
first, mention on your form that you've done so, and send me a copy of your
form and research proposal by email, to ensure that I see the application
promptly. <b>Where you have to choose a specific subject to apply under (<a
href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/finder/subjectarea.php?taught=N&sid=9">
this page</a>), to work with me you should choose Laboratory for
Foundations of Computer Science,</b> for mainly bureacratic reasons (that's the
institute where I sit, although one could make arguments for SE fitting elsewhere).

<h2>Funding</h2>

I currently have no personally-held funding for PhD students, but some
general funds are also available through the School of Informatics:
competition is fierce, however.
