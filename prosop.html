<h1>Prosopagnosia</h1>
<title>Prosopagnosia</title>

A brief explanation:

<p>

Prosopagnosia is an inability (usually partial) to recognise faces. Please
don't say "oh yes, me too, I can never remember names either". That's not
what it is. The thing I'm bad it is the earlier stage, telling whether a
face belongs to someone I know or not: I (often) don't have the
(reasonably) reliable sense of familiarity which is what sets most people
<em>trying</em> to remember a name. Once I realise that I'm supposed to
know this person, I'm not exceptionally bad at working out/remembering who
they are. So if I see you in a context where I expect to see you, and not
too many other people, you're unlikely to notice that anything's amiss. If
I pass you in the street, you may think that I'm "miles away" as I walk
past showing no sign of recognition. (And indeed I may be, but that may not
be the explanation! Even if I'm trying hard to work out whether I know you
or not, I probably can't tell.)

<p>

It isn't that I don't bother to learn to recognise people. I try hard,
often. I've tried all kinds of tricks, including taking photographs and
studying them daily.

<p>

It isn't, usually, that I'm daydreaming instead of looking at people I
might recognise, though this is often a socially acceptable "explanation".

<p>

Although prosopagnosia is called "face blindness", it of course isn't that
I don't see faces; I don't think I'm any worse than average at interpreting
facial expressions, either.

<p>

I'm at least as good as average at recognising people by their voices,
their walks or the backs of their heads, I think. I'll often walk away from
someone and look at them from a distance if I think I might be supposed to
recognise them and their face is confusing me.

<p>

There are some people I always recognise, and I do get better at
recognising a given individual over time, I think, just very slowly.


<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main thing: please don't take offence!  None is intended.

<li>If you see me (and want to talk to me!) waving is always a good idea! 
If you follow it up by telling me who you are, or if that's too unsubtle,
giving me some conversational hint about the context I should be thinking
about (i.e. the part of my mental database of features I should be
searching), that's even better.

<li>[Later addition: of course this was the most obvious killer application
for Google Glass, as far as I was concerned. But Google's reaction to
privacy concerns was to rule out such applications :-(  It's a shame,
because even a completely opt-in system - where the glass would only ever
suggest names of people who had explicitly agreed to be in the system -
would, I think, already improve my life immeasurably.] I would love it if
someone would develop a wearable computer that could help. It seems to me
that we surely have the technology, and it just needs to be put together,
maybe by a clever Informatics school somewhere... It might work like this. 
There's a camera, maybe on a headset. (Clunky? Sure. In some contexts, e.g. 
conferences, something like this could be so useful that if it
significantly helped, I wouldn't care how clunky it was.) When I'm
introduced to someone, I take a photo of them, and somehow enter the
person's name (in my Palm? using a voice recorder, transcribed later?) Thus
I build up a database of names and faces. Ideally, in fact, the database
could be "seeded" e.g. by named photos of everyone who works in my
department. Now how does the recognition work? Well, in an ideal world in
which automatic face recognition has been perfected, I just wander round
with a headset on that scans the faces of the people I pass and whispers
their names in my ear when it recognises someone. Something which I think
would be technically much easier would already be immensely useful, though:
suppose I point the device at someone and "ask" whether it's someone in my
database or not, and the software either says "no, no close match" or gives
a shortlist of 1-5 people who are close matches in the database. From that,
I could often use contextual clues to tell which of them, if any, this
person was likely to be. Then suppose I confirm (maybe by asking them :-)
that this person really is the person identified. If the image that had
been presented to the recogniser could then be stored and learned from in
order to improve the recogniser's performance, so much the better. Sound
like an AI/CogSci/CS4/MSc project? Great, I'll co-supervise with you :-)
